            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>The language diversity in India presents several challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Education:</strong> Students often struggle to learn in a language that is not their mother tongue.</li>
                <li><strong>Employment:</strong> Language barriers can limit job opportunities and career growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Integration:</strong> Difficulty in communication can hinder social interactions and integration.</li>
                <li><strong>Government Services:</strong> Access to essential services can be impeded due to language differences.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>North and South India have their own distinct languages, such as Hindi in the North and Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam in the South. These differences can create regional communication gaps and further complicate the above challenges.</p>
